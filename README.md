### Introduction:

Welcome to our Digimarket project, designed specifically for kids! As the world continues to shift towards digital learning, it is more important than ever to provide high-quality educational resources that are both engaging and accessible. Our platform aims to do just that, offering a fun and interactive way for children to learn and grow from the comfort of their own homes while simulating the in-person classroom experience as much as possible.

With our platform, organizations can collaborate with their all team members, parents and students in a private workspace and modify roles and responsibilities of each member as per their needs. From creating lessons to scheduling and using lesson’s content in interactive classrooms, every step can be handled through the platform.

Through a combination of videos, games, quizzes, and other interactive activities, our platform provides a comprehensive educational experience that is tailored to the unique needs and interests of children. We believe that education should be accessible to all, regardless of background or location. That's why our platform is designed to be easily accessible from any device with an internet connection.

### Objectives:

1. Providing facility for organizations to setup their own workspace.
2. Providing an interactive and engaging learning experience that is tailored to the needs and interests of kids.
3. Supporting the acquisition of knowledge and information in a fun and engaging way.
4. Enhancing student engagement and motivation through the interactive learning activities.
5. Supporting personalized learning by providing a variety of resources and tools to meet the diverse learning needs of students.
6. Providing teachers with a platform to monitor and assess student progress, and to provide feedback and support as needed.
7. Providing remote classrooms that simulate real classroom experience.
8. Design curriculum with all the supporting material that is required to be included in lessons
9. Managing offered courses of an organization
10. Creating, managing lesson schedules along with generating personal schedule for each user.
